# There's a lot of missing values in the critic score and count columns. There's also a lot of missing data for the user score and particularly the user count columns. I'm going to drop
# the rating column because that data is already present in the other data set. I'll also drop the developer column for the same reason. 

# Removing the rows in name and genre that have missing values. 
# Of the 8582 values that are missing in the critic score and critic count columns, all of them are missing in both columns. 

# There are 6704 rows where user score and user count are both NA. In all columns where user score is missing, it's also missing in user count. 
# In the rows where user_count is NA, it looks as though the first few rows are all "tbd". checking whether that's the case everywhere. 
# Which it is. Changing "tbd" values to NA in user_score, and checking for tbd values elsewhere, which I can't find. 
# However, on those data adventures, I found a "N/A" value in year of release. Checking for more. 
# There are 269 rows where year_of release is "N/A". 

# What am I interested in in this data set? I'm interested in critic score and user score. If I take out all of the NA values, I'll only have 7000 observations, which really isn't all that
# many. I'll drop all of the rows where both of them are NA. I'll check how different the user and critic scores, and I'll consider imputing them with the other. 
# Taking those out has left us with 573 NAs in critic score and count, and 1120 NAs in user score and count.
